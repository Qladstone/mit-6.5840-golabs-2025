# Introduction

This repository contains the lab exercises for MIT 6.5840 Distributed Systems.

https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/

The original repository may be found at:
```
git clone git://g.csail.mit.edu/6.5840-golabs-2025
```
Alternatively, you may clone this repository and use the `clone` branch which preserves the untouched lab exercises.

I will use this repository to work on the lab exercises, merging to master branch.
